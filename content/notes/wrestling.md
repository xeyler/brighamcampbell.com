Writing is thinking on hard mode. This girl I loved and grew up with broke my
heart and for some reason, the heartbreak brought a drought of thought. As long
as I'm not thinking about her, I can breath, right?

It turns out it's hard to avoid thinking of the girl when you live under her.
The girl that a long time ago had stopped saying, "if we get married...", and
had started saying, "when we get married...". Which of us did it first? Who
knows... We were just kids then.

I think about that part sometimes. The naivety of the letters and voice messages
and the way we acted. Even in the moment, the love felt so childish that it was
embarrassing. I've since decided that I will always love that way. It's
embarrassing, sure, but I am not ashamed. Why should I be?

"When we get married, I'll tell you why I like it when you scream-laugh."

There was no reason to wait until we were married, to tell you the truth. Here
it is: I liked your laugh because you never seemed to. You were ashamed of it
and your friends and family detested it. It was a disturbing, ridiculous laugh.

The perfect girl with perfect grades who always knows perfectly what to say. You
see, I don't have the same way with words. I stutter and struggle and I still
say the wrong words somehow. I _am_ awkward. And that's why I need to try. Not
because trying to do something makes me better at it, but because struggle
itself is beautiful. Love is not passion or kindness or attraction. Especially,
to love does not mean to understand. To love does _not_ mean to understand.

To love is to try. And to fail. And to try again.

I never loved you for the things that made you perfect. I loved you for all the
things that made you imperfect.

And you loved me.
