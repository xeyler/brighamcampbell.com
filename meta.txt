* I don't want to invert the color of svgs, I want the latex source to define
how it should be rendered for light/dark modes.

    in the layouts/_default/_markup/render-image.html hook, a responsive
    <picture> tag will automatically be generated if there exists a dark version
    of a resource i.e. assets/tex/foo-light.svg and assets/tex/foo-dark.svg

    allow latex sources to deal with light/dark mode by passing in a boolean
    variable at latexmk compile time

* SVG img tags should also have width and height attributes (we could use
imagemagick's `identify` to figure out the intrinsic width/height of an svg, but
preferably I'd use the same image processing backend as hugo)

* I want to be able to live-edit the entire website. Latex SVGs will re-render
when their dependencies update (including data/styleconf.json)
