* allow latex sources to detect and respond to with light/dark mode by passing
in a boolean variable at latexmk compile time

* SVG img tags should also have width and height attributes (we could use
imagemagick's `identify` to figure out the intrinsic width/height of an svg, but
preferably I'd use the same image processing backend as hugo)

* I want to be able to live-edit the entire website. Latex SVGs will re-render
when their dependencies update (including data/styleconf.json)
