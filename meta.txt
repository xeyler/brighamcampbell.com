* allow latex sources to detect and respond to with light/dark mode by passing
in a boolean variable at latexmk compile time

* SVG img tags should also have width and height attributes (we could use
imagemagick's `identify` to figure out the intrinsic width/height of an svg, but
preferably I'd use the same image processing backend as hugo)

* I want to be able to live-edit the entire website. Latex SVGs will re-render
when their dependencies update (including data/styleconf.json)

* Clean up the index.html subheader (gracefully handle the case that rss feed,
  resume, gpg key, and contact are all unavailable. and allow the maintainer
  reorganize any of the above as desired)
